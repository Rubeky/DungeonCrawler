Gameplay rules:
-	Game blocks are made up of tiles, which are 100 pixels by 100 pixels which can be moved on
-	Combat:
		Sword hits 3 blocks in front of player
		Staff hit 3 blocks ahead in straight line
		Pickaxe only affects specific wall, straight ahead
-	UI:
		Items in inventory are shown (so far, sword, staff, pickaxe)
		Health bar (Solid bar, percentage of it filled because hearts would be like Minecraft)
-	Walls and obstacles are stored in the same layer as strings
-	Background moves, player doesnâ€™t, though player has walking animation
-	There is a vision ring around the player in a circle, so further away items are not visible on screen, though sounds will be added later in development
-	Game consists of player making their way through a set of randomly selected premade rooms (stored in json format?)
-	Interactions with the environment include:
		Walking into spikes, takes damage
		Falling into spike pit, instant death, falling animation?
		Walking into wall, nothing happens, no in-game time passes
		Walking in straight line, walking animation
		Pickaxe: breaking cracked wall
		Sword: swipe in front of player, damages enemies, breaks breakable items
		Staff: fires projectile ahead, passes through enemies, damaging them, also breaks cracked walls and breakable items (you get this item later)
- All movements are to be done in "pixels", where each pixel is actually 16 pixels (4x4) on screen



TODO:
	- Make/Find images for game, all of which are either on a slight angle, or top-down
		- Player, tiles(5), walls(3), pit trap, pots, coins(1), enemies(2), circle of vision(2 sizes)

	- Make/find sounds for the game, all of which are somewhat muffled except the endgame stuff?
	 	- Walking, ambient noises (muffled thudding, crumbling sounds, landslides?), sword swiping,
			staff firing fireball, pickaxe mining, exit door opening?

	- Come up with some aspect of mythology for future?
		- Maybe lovecraftian-esque story?

	- Some puzzle aspect, but only in quite a light way
		- Box pushing, lighting torches, a way out of each level??

Priority items:
	- Find way desaturating everything a bit
	- Draw walls and obstacles
	- Enable obstacle detection
